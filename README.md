# impyter
Library to impute missing values by prediction using state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms.

## Value Imputation
One essential problem for any person dealing with data are missing values. There are several possibilities when it comes to dealing with missing information, ranging from dropping the case to calculating its value based on other values in that column (i.e. average or median values). Another more current method involves machine-learning algorithms. This module offers an easy to use piece of code, to calculate missing information based on the underlying relationship within the data.

## Requirements
- [Python 2.x](https://www.python.org/)
- [sklearn](http://scikit-learn.org/)

## Limits and Notes
The current version is a work in progress.

## Functions
impyter focuses on two main goals: 
1) Easy to interpret visualization of missing patterns
2) Easy imputation of missing values
