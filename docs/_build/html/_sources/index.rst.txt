Welcome to impyte
=================
Impyte is a Python module to impute missing values by prediction using machine learning algorithms.

Introduction
^^^^^^^^^^^^
One essential problem for any person dealing with data is missing values.
There are several possibilities to deal with missing information, ranging
from dropping data points to estimating the value based on other values
in that column (i.e. average or median values).
A more recent method involves machine-learning algorithms.
This module offers a lightweight Python solution to calculate missing
information based on the underlying relationship between data points.

The main goal of this module is to support people who are dealing
with missing information to gather additional insights about the
different patterns and impute them in an easy way.

There are two essential features to this module:

1. Visualization of Patterns
2. Imputation of missing information

Yet :mod:`impyte` is only one piece of the equation. In order to
maximize the return in any value imputation process a deep understanding
of the data is needed. As well as thorough pre-processing and cleaning
of the data. Imyte takes on some of the challenges but tends to work best
in concert with additional data science endeavors.

To get started with impyte is as simple as::

    from impyte import impyte
    imp = impyte.Impyter()
    imp.load_data(missing_data)
    imp.impute()


Installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Since this module is still in beta, you can install the latest version
through its `github`_ repository via pip. ::

   pip install git+git://github.com/andirs/impyte.git

There is also a manual way of importing the module in your project. To do so, download the `repository`_ to the folder you are performing your data work in. Afterwards you'll be able to import the :mod:`impyte` functionality through following command: ::

    from impyte import impyte

Requirements
^^^^^^^^^^^^
The requirements are listed in ``requirements.txt`` and will usually
be installed when proceeding through pip. When installing manually,
please make sure following modules are already installed:

- `Python 3.6`_
- `sklearn 0.19`_
- `pandas 0.21`_
- `scipy 0.19`_
- `pathlib 1.0.1`_

FAQs
^^^^
Below are some pointers towards the right direction if something breaks.
If you encounter any other error please feel free to reach out.

**When imputing my estimator raises ValueError: Unknown label type: 'continuous'**

    .. hint::
            This might happen, if there is too little information for impyte to
            correctly distinguish your data type. This error essentially means,
            you're handing a continuous data type [i.e. a float] to a classifier
            which expects a class or discrete value.

            To solve this problem, you can set the unique value threshold to a
            lower value. (standard value is 10 unique instances).
